# Job finder tool 

## Overview
### Main goal:

- A local website that has links to appropriate jobs held on online job boards

### Future possibilities:

- show hourly rate
- default to not showing previously applied jobs
- label for each link for how easy it is to apply i.e.
    - 1 = very simple, has "apply now" button
    - 2 = must apply on company website
    - 3 = call company
- automate the application for the jobs found
